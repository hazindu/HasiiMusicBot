# ✨ Features

### 🎵 High-Quality Audio Streaming

Experience smooth and crystal-clear music playback optimized for Telegram voice chats using the Opus codec and FFmpeg.

### 🎧 YouTube Integration

Play music instantly from:

- YouTube links
- Search queries
- Supported playlists

### 📻 Live Radio Streaming

Access and stream a collection of online radio stations directly within Telegram voice chats.

### 📝 Smart Queue Management

Manage playlists effortlessly with a built-in queue system.

- Add songs
- View queue
- Skip tracks
- Clear queue

### ⚡ Optimized Performance

Built with asynchronous libraries for efficient resource usage and responsive performance.

### 🎛 Playback Controls

Complete playback management with support for:

- Play
- Pause
- Resume
- Skip
- Stop
- Seek

### 👥 Authorization System

Restrict playback controls to:

- Chat administrators
- Authorized users
- Bot owner
- Sudo users

The requester of the current track can also use its playback buttons while that
track remains current. This does not add them to the authorized-user list or
grant access to admin commands. Force-playing a queued track remains restricted
to administrators, authorized users, and sudo users.

The existing effects of the buttons still apply: Stop clears the queue, and Loop
changes the group's loop mode. When the track changes, its requester loses this
temporary access unless they already have one of the roles above.

### 🔄 Automatic Voice Chat Cleanup

Automatically detects inactive voice chats and leaves them to conserve server resources.

### 🐳 Docker Ready

Deploy effortlessly using Docker or Docker Compose for a consistent production environment.

### 🔧 Easy Configuration

Configure the bot entirely through environment variables without modifying the source code.
